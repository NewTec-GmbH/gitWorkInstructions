# Github

GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

## User Profile

Each user requires an user profile (an account) in GitHub to be able to use its features. These are free-of-charge and you can customize your profile to your liking.

## SSH Keys

In order to clone and have local access to the repositories, you need to setup SSH keys in your GitHub profile. You can follow the [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) to achieve this. Make sure that you have [Git](./git.md) installed before starting.

Refer to the [Git page](./git.md) if any errors occur.
