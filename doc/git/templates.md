# Templates

Starting a project may be difficult without knowing the structure that it should have or what details you have to take into account. Therefore we have created some templates for the different kinds of projects that we have.

:::{hint}
You can request a new template project if there is none for your programming language or environment. Contact your supervisor for more information.
:::

:::{important}
The templates are private repositories and you must be part of the organization see them.

The Python project template can be found [here](https://github.com/NewTec-GmbH/template_python)
