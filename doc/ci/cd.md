# Continous Deployment

Similar to [Continuous Integration](./ci.md), Continuous Deployment is a strategy in software development where code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment. (Source: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-deployment))

## Github Actions

[GitHub Actions](./ci.md#github-actions) are also used for CD. An example workflow that uses CD can be found in the sources of this documentation, as each time a release is performed, the build and deployment process are done automatically.
